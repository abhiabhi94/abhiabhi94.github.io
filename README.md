## Personal blog

### These instructions are for my future self

### Adding a post

- Add a file in the directory `content/posts/something.md`
- Copy the contents of any of the post.
- Edit the `title`, `tags`, `category` as per need.
- Once finished, you can check the blog locally by running

```sh
hugo serve
```

#### Deployment

Just pushing the changes to the `main` branch on github 
should be sufficient to deploy. You can view the deployments
under the Actions tab.
